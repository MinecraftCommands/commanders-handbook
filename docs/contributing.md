You can submit an article through GitHub:
- Fork the [repository]({{ site.github.repository_url }})
- Add your article to `docs/_posts` following the existing format
- If this is your first time contributing, add yourself to `/docs/_authors`
- Submit a pull request

If you don't have a GitHub account, you're welcome to submit your article through one of the maintainers and they will add it for you.
